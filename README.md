## Nutrition
### PCA and K-Means Clustering Methods

### This project has been prepared for the module MT5758 Multivariate Analysis. Please refer to the PDF for the full breakdown.

Nutrition is linked to both physical and mental well-being, the USDA National Nutrient data set (Kelly, 2020) offers the opportunity to conduct statistical analysis and build a model for real-world implications based on suggested daily nutritional intake (Benton & Young, 2018). Extreme diets are experiencing a surge in popularity, whether driven by new social norms or heightened marketing efforts emphasising their potential health and sustainability benefits, which should be well-researched (Clarys, P. et al., 2014). It would be highly beneficial to gain an understanding of a potentially healthy diet that does not necessitate the use of extra supplements. The goal of this analysis is to investigate the potential for differentiating food groups based on their nutritional values. To achieve the aims, Principal Component Analysis is employed, followed by the K-Means Clustering method. The results could provide a useful framework for identifying which foods should be prioritised in oneâ€™s diet.
